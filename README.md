This is a simple html page which has a list of recipes with their respective links to them.

My expectations when making this project are:
 - Getting started on the Git workflow, and getting used to the add, commit, push, etc. commands.
 - Getting frist impressions on HTML, and creating a page with an actual purpose.
  - Just having some fun! Figuring out how to do the lists of the recipes, which I feel confident on so far.

See you on the other side!
