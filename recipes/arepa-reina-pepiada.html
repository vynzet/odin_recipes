    <h1>Arepa Reina Pepiada</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the arepas</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>2 cups of precooked corn flour 290 g.</li>
        <li>2 Â¼ cups of warm water 510 ml.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 shredded roasted chicken breast, 300 g.</li>
        <li>2 sprigs of cilantro.</li>
        <li>1 small garlic clove.</li>
        <li>1 medium onion 80 g.</li>
        <li>1 ripe avocado 300 g.</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of lemon juice</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the arepas</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the warm water in a mixing bowl. Then add the salt, and a tablespoon of oil, stir.</li>
        <li> Add the flour stirring constantly with a spoon. Knead until you get a nice and smooth consistency, without lumps.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into six equal-sized balls and form the arepas by flattening them between your hands. Spread the remaining tablespoon of oil on the surface of a frying pan.</li>
        <li>Turn the stove on medium high heat, and place the arepas to cook covered, with enough space between them.</li>
        <li>When the first five minutes have passed, turn them over and cook covered for another five minutes on the opposite side. Remove them and let them rest.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the avocado, reserve at least 25% of it to serve sliced inside the arepas, and mash the rest.</li>
        <li>Cut the other part of the avocado into thin slices. To prevent the avocado from turning black, you can sprinkle with a few drops of lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the onion and cilantro. Crush the garlic clove. Place the seasonings in a bowl and mix with the olive oil, lemon juice, salt and mayonnaise.</li>
        <li>Pour the mashed avocado into the bowl with the mayonnaise and stir until a smooth paste is formed.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded chicken. Mix everything with a wooden spoon. Taste and adjust salt if necessary.</li>
        <li>With a sharp knife, open the arepas, remove the excess dough, and fill to your liking. Remember to leave a little space to place some avocado slices.</li>
